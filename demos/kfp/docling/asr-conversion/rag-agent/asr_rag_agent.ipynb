End users consume the final product.\\nInteract with a chat GPT-like application. Builders create and configure the AI systems\\nused by end users. Configure a Rack backend tweaking parameters for a specific\\nexperience such as chat GPT. We are targeting builders not end users. Builders optimize\\ntheir systems for their specific end users. Builder archetypes. High-coder builders aka\\nProCode prefer SDKs and code-based solutions. They need access to all configurable\\nparameters via APIs and SDKs. They may also want a quick way to wipe check their Rack\\nsystem via a UI. Example, LamaStackCliMyRackApp.py-web.\\nLow-coder builders. No low-code. Prefer UI-driven workflows and visual tools to configure their\\nsystems. They could benefit from tools like the existing LamaStackPlayground and so on.\\nBuilders vs. Platformers vs. Opsers. Builders, AI Engineers and AI Devs. They use the platform\\nand its primitives to build AI systems. Their skill set and the complexity of their tasks determine\\nwhether they are considered AI engineers or AI Devs. Platformers. AI Platform Engineers.\\nPlatformers focus on building, maintaining, and securing the AI platform and APIs. They serve\\nboth builders for development and opsors for development slash operations, ensuring infrastructure\\nis reliable, scalable, and supports self-service.\\nOpsers. AI ML Ops Engineers. Opsers focus on operationalizing and automating the AI ML life\\ncycle. For example, they use platform APIs to deploy, monitor, and manage models, enabling\\nbuilders models to reach and succeed in production. Opsors work closely with platformers to ensure\\ninfrastructure meets operational needs.\\nIn summary, platformers enable builders and other developers to create systems for end-users.\\nThe Red Hat Rack team focus is on empowering builders with the tools and flexibility they need to\\nbuild the best experience for their end-users.\\nThere are new levers there are new leaders.\\nManyоф methods of lobbying.\\nThere are streams that have owned by AWS company its venir using a light El��게 and construction\\nprotection.\\nMetadata: {'file_name': 'RAG_customers', 'document_id': 'd33413d1-5770-42ab-9851-e4e6c0cb661a'}\\n\", type='text'), TextContentItem(text=\"Result 5\\nContent: I've on my sca beans I've called for OUTON card.\\nI've bought a neighbors and everyone's rules on the container.\\nMetadata: {'file_name': 'RAG_customers', 'document_id': '7f50b0c6-8117-40b9-8774-19c6d1b88af5'}\\n\", type='text'), TextContentItem(text='END of knowledge_search tool results.\\n', type='text'), TextContentItem(text='The above results were retrieved to help answer the user\\'s query: \"Regular LLM output disadvantages\".

    "\n",
    "Builder Archetypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Coder Builders (aka pro-code): Prefer SDKs and code-based solutions. They need access to all configurable parameters via APIs and SDKs.  They may also want a quick way to \"vibe check\" their RAG system via a UI (e.g., llama-stack-cli my-rag-app.py --web).\n",

    "Opsers (AI/MLOps Engineers): Opsers focus on operationalizing and automating the AI/ML  lifecycle.
