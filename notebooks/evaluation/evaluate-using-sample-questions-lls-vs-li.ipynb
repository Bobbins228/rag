      "The causes of World War I are complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of political, economic, and social factors. Here are some of the key reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Alliance System**: Europe was divided into two main alliance systems: the Triple Entente (comprising France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and the Triple Alliance (comprising Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy). These alliances were meant to provide mutual defense and maintain a balance of power, but they also meant that any conflict involving one country could quickly involve others.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Nationalism**: Nationalistic fervor was on the rise in many parts of Europe, leading to competitive and antagonistic relationships between nations. Ethnic groups within multi-national empires, such as the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, sought independence, further destabilizing the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Imperialism**: The major European powers were competing for colonies and influence around the world. This competition often led to conflicts and rivalries, particularly in Africa and Asia, which heightened tensions between the powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Militarism**: There was a significant build-up of military forces and an arms race, particularly between Germany and the United Kingdom. This militarization created an environment where war was seen as an acceptable means of resolving disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand**: The immediate catalyst for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, on June 28, 1914. This event set off a chain reaction of diplomatic crises and ultimatums.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **The July Crisis**: Following the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which led to a series of diplomatic failures and mobilizations. Russia mobilized in defense of Serbia, Germany declared war on Russia, and France and Britain were drawn in due to their alliances.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Failure of Diplomacy**: Diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis failed, partly due to miscommunications, rigid military plans, and a lack of effective international institutions to mediate the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors combined to create a situation where a regional conflict escalated into a full-scale world war, involving many of the world's great powers.\n"

       "   \"## Management Discussion\\n\\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\\n\\nSoftware revenue of $27,085 million increased 8.3 percent as reported (9.0 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit growth in Red Hat and Automation and high single-digit growth  in  Transaction  Processing.  This  revenue  performance  reflects  the  investments  we  have  been  making  in  Software,  both organically and through acquisitions. Our investments in generative AI are contributing to growth, as we had strong demand for our generative AI products such as watsonx, Concert and our AI assistants. We also launched new products in the fourth quarter of 2024  including  our  next  generation  of  watsonx  Code  Assistant  and  Guardium  Quantum  Safe.  In  2024,  we  also  had  increased revenue contribution from acquisitions compared to the prior year, including Apptio and StreamSets and webMethods. In addition, we  had  solid  growth  in  our  recurring  revenue  and  double-digit  growth  in  our  transactional  software  revenue  in  2024,  as  we accelerated growth through innovation across our Software portfolio.\\n\\nHybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue of $18,808 million increased 8.1 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. Within Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat revenue increased 11.4 percent as reported (12.0 percent  adjusted  for  currency),  which  reflects  the  continued  demand  for  our  hybrid  cloud  solutions  as  clients  are  prioritizing application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spending and reduce operational complexity. In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. The performance in 2024 is the result of the combination of clients' growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates,  and  increased  contribution  from  our  generative  AI  products,  including  watsonx  code  assistant  for  Z.  This  growth reflects the innovation and value of our transaction processing software, which helps our clients manage their most mission-critical workloads.\",\n",

       "   \"## Management Discussion\\n\\nInternational Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\\n\\nSoftware revenue of $27,085 million increased 8.3 percent as reported (9.0 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year, reflecting growth across all lines of business with double-digit growth in Red Hat and Automation and high single-digit growth  in  Transaction  Processing.  This  revenue  performance  reflects  the  investments  we  have  been  making  in  Software,  both organically and through acquisitions. Our investments in generative AI are contributing to growth, as we had strong demand for our generative AI products such as watsonx, Concert and our AI assistants. We also launched new products in the fourth quarter of 2024  including  our  next  generation  of  watsonx  Code  Assistant  and  Guardium  Quantum  Safe.  In  2024,  we  also  had  increased revenue contribution from acquisitions compared to the prior year, including Apptio and StreamSets and webMethods. In addition, we  had  solid  growth  in  our  recurring  revenue  and  double-digit  growth  in  our  transactional  software  revenue  in  2024,  as  we accelerated growth through innovation across our Software portfolio.\\n\\nHybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue of $18,808 million increased 8.1 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. Within Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat revenue increased 11.4 percent as reported (12.0 percent  adjusted  for  currency),  which  reflects  the  continued  demand  for  our  hybrid  cloud  solutions  as  clients  are  prioritizing application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spending and reduce operational complexity. In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. The performance in 2024 is the result of the combination of clients' growing capacity demands, solid renewal rates,  and  increased  contribution  from  our  generative  AI  products,  including  watsonx  code  assistant  for  Z.  This  growth reflects the innovation and value of our transaction processing software, which helps our clients manage their most mission-critical workloads.\",\n",

This  revenue  performance  reflects  the  investments  we  have  been  making  in  Software,  both organically and through acquisitions. Our investments in generative AI are contributing to growth, as we had strong demand for our generative AI products such as watsonx, Concert and our AI assistants. We also launched new products in the fourth quarter of 2024  including  our  next  generation  of  watsonx  Code  Assistant  and  Guardium  Quantum  Safe.  In  2024,  we  also  had  increased revenue contribution from acquisitions compared to the prior year, including Apptio and StreamSets and webMethods. In addition, we  had  solid  growth  in  our  recurring  revenue  and  double-digit  growth  in  our  transactional  software  revenue  in  2024,  as  we accelerated growth through innovation across our Software portfolio.\\n\\nHybrid Platform &amp; Solutions revenue of $18,808 million increased 8.1 percent as reported (8.7 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year. Within Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, Red Hat revenue increased 11.4 percent as reported (12.0 percent  adjusted  for  currency),  which  reflects  the  continued  demand  for  our  hybrid  cloud  solutions  as  clients  are  prioritizing application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spending and reduce operational complexity. In 2024, we had double-digit revenue growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and high single-digit revenue growth in RHEL. The  growth  in  OpenShift  revenue  reflects  increased  volume  in  OpenShift  Virtualization  engagements,  and  we  exited  2024  with OpenShift annual recurring revenue of $1.4 billion. Automation revenue increased 14.2 percent as reported (14.8 percent adjusted for  currency),  driven  by  our  SaaS  subscription  offerings  such  as  AIOps  and  Management,  which  includes  the  higher  revenue contribution  from Apptio.  Data  &amp;  AI  revenue  increased  1.6  percent  as  reported  (2.2  percent  adjusted  for  currency),  with  strong growth in  Data  Fabric  and  our  AI  assistant  for  Customer  Care,  driven  by  client  demand  for  our  watsonx  platform  offerings,  and strength  in  asset  and  supply  chain  management  software  which  helps  clients  run  sustainable  operations.  Security  revenue increased 0.8 percent as reported (1.5 percent adjusted for currency), with revenue growth in data security and identity and access management, partially offset by a revenue decline in security threat management.\\n\\nAcross Hybrid Platform &amp; Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $15.3 billion exiting 2024, growing at a double-digit rate compared to the prior year. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our  Hybrid  Platform  &amp;  Solutions  business  within  the  Software  segment.  The  metric  was  updated  in  the  first  quarter  of 2024  to reflect the organizational changes described in the 'Organization of Information' section above, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is  calculated  by  using  the  current  quarter's  recurring  revenue  and  then  multiplying  that  value  by  four.  This  value  includes  the following  consumption  models:  (1)  software  subscription  agreements,  including  committed  term  licenses,  (2)  as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.\\n\\nTransaction Processing revenue of $8,277 million increased 8.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2024 compared to the prior year.

       "   'DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\\nPlease refer to IBM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February\\xa025, 2025, for Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.”\\nIBM is addressing the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity with a platform-centric approach, focused on providing client value through a \\ncombination of technology and business expertise. We provide integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information \\ntechnology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and \\nalliances. Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology and services capabilities support clients’ digital transformations and help \\nthem engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of \\ncapabilities in software, consulting services and a deep incumbency in mission-critical systems, all bolstered by one of the world’s \\nleading research organizations.\\nIBM Strategy                \\nOver the past 5 years, IBM has shifted to higher growth areas, with approximately 75 percent of our business mix in Software and \\nConsulting. Our strategic focus is hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI), today’s most transformative technologies. As clients \\ndrive business growth using their existing technology and investing in new ones, they seek flexibility across distributed technology \\nenvironments and the need to realize value from AI. We have shaped our business to focus on those client needs.\\nOur strategy aligns with the needs of our clients \\nCompanies are increasingly deploying technology workloads across environments where the business runs, with over 90 percent of \\nexecutives reporting moving to hybrid cloud architectures (IBM IBV). As organizations continue to face innovation challenges, \\nincluding increased technical complexity, rapidly growing costs, and scarcity of expertise, AI is an opportunity to unlock unrealized \\nvalue. However, AI brings similar challenges, including costs of AI models, complexity of AI solutions and its governance, and \\nexpertise gaps in integrating AI solutions into business workflows.\\nTo solve these innovation challenges, leading organizations are embracing a hybrid ‘by design’ platform approach. It allows them to \\ntake advantage of hybrid multi-cloud by minimizing cost and complexity which simplifies innovation and operations. IBM Consulting \\nhas quantified the value of a hybrid by design approach and shown it delivers over three times higher return on investment.\\nCompanies continue to invest in AI and are looking for better approaches to drive enterprise AI adoption. AI is inherently hybrid as it \\nneeds to inference, govern, and manage across multiple environments. Conversely, AI simplifies the complexity of hybrid cloud \\nenvironments through visibility, resource optimization, and automation across platforms and processes.\\nIBM is strategically positioned to help clients unlock their next chapter of technology-led business growth. It will be built across \\nhybrid multi-cloud and leverage AI. With our portfolio of technology and consulting capabilities, we uniquely help deliver that \\ngrowth. \\nIBM’s differentiated portfolio value \\nIBM Software  makes technology that delivers innovation and productivity with capabilities to enable end-to-end enterprise use \\ncases, client usage, consumption, and expansion. We deliver this value in four major areas: Transaction Processing, powering IBM Z \\nto deliver unmatched scalability, security, availability and real-time fraud detection for our client’s mission-critical workloads; \\nAutomation, boosting application performance and optimizing costs across clients’ technology operations and reducing overall \\ncomplexity; Data, accelerating productivity by infusing AI at scale into applications and business processes to drive decisions in \\nreal-time; Hybrid cloud platform (Red Hat), unifying on-prem, public and private clouds, and the edge to scale applications and AI \\nmodels across environments. All capabilities support hybrid cloud deployment and have security and AI embedded throughout.\\nIBM Consulting  provides strategy & technology and intelligent operations services to address clients’ most challenging business \\ngoals – including how to be more productive, accelerate growth, and drive innovation. We deliver domain expertise to drive client \\nadoption through our offerings, leveraging hybrid cloud and AI technologies from IBM Software and with strategic partners including \\nAWS, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and many others across the ecosystem. IBM Consulting brings speed and scale to innovative solutions \\nthat combine industry, domain, and hybrid cloud knowledge together with AI-powered assets, such as IBM Consulting Advantage, a \\nfirst of its kind AI delivery platform designed to deliver solutions at scale and realize faster time to value, transforming how our \\nconsultants work.\\nIBM Infrastructure  enables hybrid cloud environments for mission-critical transactions and AI workloads, while maintaining the \\nhighest security and availability.
